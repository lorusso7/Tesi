\textit{%As described in Sec.~\ref{NSP}, the research of  new resonance $X$ is one of the mail goals of LHC. With a energy achieved of 13 TeV in the center of mass and the data collected in 2016, it is possible to lead searches in a vast range of mass. One of the main final state channel in in a couple of $W^+W^-$ bosons.
In this chapter the $X \to \mathrm{W^+W^-}\to2\ell2\nu$ analysis using 2016 data is reported. To increase the sensitivity of this search, the signal must be selected in the most efficient way by reducing the
presence of the backgrounds with a similar signature: the selection criteria are described in detail. I have participated at all stages of the analysis selection (signal simulation, categorization, background estimation, etc.)  and I have been responsible for the whole analysis.} 
%The ATLAS experiment has been done this kind of searches using the early 2016 statistic, 13.2 fb$^{-1}$ and the results are shown in Fig.~\ref{ATLAS-CONF-2016-074_fig}.
%With the full 2016 statistic, approximately $\sim 36$ fb$^{-1}$ is possible to investigate a wide range of masses and, if will be no evidence of high mass signal, is possible to set  tight upper limits on the possible cross section.

\section{Overview of the fully leptonic analysis }\label{sec:AnalysisStrategy_Intro}
The analysis strategy for the high mass search in the $X \to \mathrm{W^+W^-}\to2\ell2\nu$ final state must take into account the production modes of the new scalar, the main backgrounds, and the interference among the different processes. 

The main production mode for a Higgs-like particle over the all mass spectrum is the gluon-gluon fusion process. 
However the ratio of the VBF cross-section to the gluon-gluon fusion cross-section increases with $m_\mathrm{X}$ (see Fig.~\ref{prod}), making the VBF production mechanism more and more important.\\

Among the SM processes that have the same final state of the signal or a similar one the most important are non-resonant WW production, top pairs production, Drell-Yan. The WW production is an irreducible background and needs to be determined together with the signal in the fit. To estimate the other background processes, control regions are defined on data and compared to simulation. \\
The events are first divided according the flavour in the final state: 
\begin{itemize}
\item opposite-flavour final state, $e^{\pm} \mu^{\mp}$,
\item same-flavour final state, $e^+ e^-$ and  $\mu^+ \mu^-$. 
\end{itemize}
In the opposite-flavour final state four different jets categories are defined: the 0-jet, the 1-jet, the 2-jet and the VBF, Sec.~\ref{sec:OF}. 
In the same-flavour final state only the VBF category is considered. Indeed, only the VBF selection cuts are sufficiently tight to reduce the  overwhelming Z plus jets background to a manageable level, Sec.~\ref{sec:SF}. The jets categories improve the sensitivity of the analysis, because each category has different contributions from signal production modes and backgrounds.

The signal is interpreted in terms of the EWK singlet and MSSM models as described in Sec~\ref{NSP}. The Higgs boson width and lineshape is reweighted at generator level according to the parameters defined in the model. The interference effects between the signal produced via gluon-gluon fusion, the WW background also from gluon-gluon fusion, and SM Higgs boson, are expected to change the shape of the signal distribution and have been fully taken into account. 
A similar treatment is also applied for the interference between high mass signal produced via VBF, the WW plus two quarks background (emerging from the same initial state) and the SM Higgs generated with VBF production mechanism. In general, the interference becomes more and more important as the mass of $X$ increase and it is studied in detail in Sec~\ref{sec:signalModel}.
Finally, the interference between the $\mathrm{W^+W^-}\to2\ell2\nu$ and $\mathrm{ZZ}\to2\ell2\nu$ is negligible due to the different phase space characteristic of these processes.




\section{Main Background processes}
\label{anbkg}
Inside the SM that are several processes that have the same or a similar final state of the signal, called background processes. The most important background processes contributing to this final state are non resonant $q\bar{q} \to W^+ W^-$, the top production ($t\bar{t}$ and single-top) and  the Drell-Yan process. 
Other background the $W$ and the $Z$ bosons.
All these processes have been simulated with Monte Carlo generators and the simulation details have been discussed in Sec~\ref{MSsample}.
Following, the description of the main different background processes:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Non-resonant WW} ($q\bar{q} \to W^+ W^-$): this background is characterized by a final state identical to the signal, however the lepton kinematics for signal and $q\bar{q} \to W^+ W^-$ processes is rather different.
For the signal process, the W bosons originate from a spin-0 particle decay
and their spins must therefore be antiparallel, implying that the charged leptons pro-
duced in their decays appear preferentially in the same hemisphere~\cite{Ellis:2012wg}. In contrast,
there is no preferential spin direction in the background case. For this reason the
azimuthal angle difference between the two leptons is on average smaller for signal
than for background, resulting in a smaller dilepton invariant mass in the former case. The Feynman diagram of the process is reported below.
\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\vspace{0.5cm}
\includegraphics[scale= 0.9]{../Cap5/nnr_WW}
\end{figure}
\item \textit{Top} ($t\bar{t}$ and single-top): the $t\bar{t}$ events can give a signal-like signature if the decay chain is $t \to Wb$ and subsequently $W \o \ell \nu$.  In such a case, in fact, there are two leptons and two jets (from the hadronization of the $b$ quark) in the final state. This process is especially important when the signal is produced via VBS or when the signal in produced with jets coming from initial or final state radiation. The single-top instead is characterized by the presence of $W$ boson and a top quark. Following, some examples of Feynman diagrams for the top background. The $t\bar{t}$ in (a) and (b) diagrams, the single-top in (c).

{\includegraphics[scale= 0.5]{../Cap5/st_bg}}
\end{figure}
%\newpage
\item \textit{Drell-Yan}: the Drell-Yan process is defined as the annihilation of a quark-antiquark pair into a lepton-antilepton pair. his process is described at leading order by
the two Feynman diagrams drawn. These two amplitudes are proportional to the fine structure constant $\alpha \sim 1/137$.
This kind of background is particular important for the same flavour final state of the signal having two leptons  of same flavour.
\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\vspace{0.5cm}
\includegraphics[scale= 0.7]{../Cap5/dy}
\end{figure}

\item \textit{W+jet}: this background is charaterized by a $W$ boson, decaying in $\ell \nu$ in addition to a jet. A fake lepton arise from the misidentified jet and lead the same final state of the signal (two leptons and missing-transverse-energy). 

\item \textit{Other}: other background processes involved the Z bosons, such as $WZ/W\gamma^*$, $ZZ^*$ with a misidentified lepton and $Z\gamma$ with $\gamma$ conversion.

\end{itemize}
The main background processes the \WW production and the top production  are estimated using data. 
Instrumental backgrounds arising from non-prompt leptons in $W+$jets production and mis-measurement of $E_T^{miss}$ in Drell-Yan events are also estimated from
data. The contribution from W$\gamma^*$  is estimated partly from data. The
contribution of other sub-dominant backgrounds is obtained directly from simulated samples. The different data-driven background estimations are explained in the following sections. More precisely top and  Drell-Yan backgrounds normalizations have been extracted
directly from data-simulation comparison in specific control regions enriched in either one
or the other background separately for the different events categories, using the rateParam feature of the combine package~\cite{combine}.


\section{Lepton Efficiencies from Tag and Probe Method}
\label{TP}
One of the well established data-driven approach for measuring the particle efficiencies is the
so called Tag and Probe method. The Tag and probe method uses a known mass resonance (e.g. $J/\Psi$, $Z$) to select particles of the desired type, and probe the efficiency of a particular
selection criterion on these particles. In general the “tag” is an object that passes a set of very
tight selection criteria designed to isolate the required particle type. Tags are often referred
to as a “golden” electrons or muons and the fake rate for passing tag selection criteria should
be very small. A generic set of the desired particle type (i.e. with potentially very loose se-
lection criteria) known as “probes” is selected by pairing these objects with tags such that the
invariant mass of the combination is consistent with the mass of the resonance. Combinatoric
backgrounds may be eliminated through any of a variety of background subtraction methods
such as fitting, or sideband subtraction. The definition of the probe objects depend on the specifics of the selection criterion being examined. The simple expression to get the efficiency as a function of $p_T$ and $\eta$ is given below:
\begin{equation}
\epsilon=\frac{N_{Pass}^{Probes}}{N_{Pass}^{Probes}+N_{Fail}^{Probes}}
\end{equation}

\subsection*{Electrons} 
The   Tag and Probe is used here to get the identification and isolation efficiency of electrons. In this case, the Tag is a
well identified and isolated electron which also passes an electron trigger to increase the purity. 
Once the Tag electron is selected then another object that passing the kinematic electron selection, Tab.~\ref{IDe}, is searched. 
The invariant  mass of the Tag and the Probe electron pair is reconstructed
and window  around  the Z boson mass is imposed. 
After that, to compute the efficiency, the Probe electron is required  to pass the identification tight working point. 
This procedure is performed for the data and the MC samples. 
Once  calculated  the data and MC efficiencies,  the electron scale factors are estimated as the ratio among the data and MC efficiencies. 
The scale factors goals is to correct the difference in efficiencies between data and MC in the analysis. 
%The Pile-Up reweighting is also applied on MC during the computation of efficiencies. 
%A MC truth matching has also been applied in case of the computation using simulation. 
%In principle, there are two methods to estimate the efficiencies.
%The first one is the \textit{counting method} and the other one is the \textit{fitting method}. 
%The counting method is used when there  are small backgrounds, instead  the fitting method instead when the backgrounds are 
%In order to take into account the effect of DY background in the efficiency estimation,  a fitting method has been used. 
%Tag and Probe pairs are  selected in Z mass window of 60 to 120 GeV.
%If there exist more than one pair then the one whose invariant mass closer to Z pole mass has been selected.
%The efficiencies have been computed as a function of $p_T$ and $\eta$ of electron.
%For signal fitting, MC templates are derived from the simulated sample in the Z mass range 60 to 120 GeV in  $p_T$ and $\eta$ bins.
%The MC Templates are then smeared using Gaussian function. For the background fitting a function, that is combination of
%an exponential function and an error function, has been used.
%The exponential decay distribution becomes
%active at high mass beyond the Z peak and the error function takes over at low masses due to
%threshold effect.
%A fit examples for all $p_T$ bins is shown in Fig.~\ref{ac}
%\begin{figure}
%\centering
%\includegraphics[scale= 0.5]{tpe}
%\caption{Fits for $p_T$ bin (35-50) GeV and $\eta$ in (-2.5,-2.0) bin.}
%\label{ac}
%\end{figure}
The  electron  efficiencies are measured to be  more than 95\%.


\subsection*{Muons} 
The muon identification and isolation efficiency is studied and compared to the prediction of MC in order
to understand if a correction is needed. The muon efficiency is obtained as
\begin{equation}
\epsilon_{\mu} = \epsilon_{TRK} \times \epsilon_{Tight} \times \epsilon_{ISO \; Tight} \; ,
\end{equation}
\newline
where $ \epsilon_{TRK}$ is the tracker  muon efficiency.  
The $ \epsilon_{Tight} $ is muon efficiency
under the assumption that the muon passes the kinematic selections summarized in  Tab.~\ref{IDm}.
The $\epsilon_{ISO_Tight}$ is the efficiency of the isolation criteria under the assumption that the muon passes the same selection.
The $\epsilon_{Tight}$ and $ \epsilon_{ISO \; Tight}$ are determined  using the Tag and Probe method. 
The Tag muon is obtained by applying  the kinematic selections  and   the isolated muon trigger  with $p_T^{\mu}>20$ GeV.
The Probe muon  is requested to pass the kinematic selection and the isolation criteria.
After that it is checked if the Probe muon is matched to the muon trigger. 
In general the efficiencies are relatively high due to the lower cut on $p_T$ and the looser cut on
isolation %in the double lepton trigger compared to single muon trigger. 
The efficiencies value on the plateau is around 93\%-99\%.



\section{Triggers and Data sample}

\subsection*{Triggers path and  efficiency}
Events are required to fire one of the unprescaled single-electron, single-muon or
muon-electron triggers. Due to the rather high LHC instantaneous luminosity the
single-lepton triggers must have high HLT $p_T$ thresholds, otherwise the rate of these
triggers would be too large to be sustained. The double-lepton triggers allow the $p_T$
thresholds to be lowered while keeping a sustainable trigger rate, thus maintaining a
good sensitivity to the Higgs boson signal, for which the lepton  $p_T$ can be rather small.
The triggers used in the analysis are summarized in Table~\ref{tab:triggers} 
In final state with two leptons is searched, therefore a combination of both single and double lepton triggers are used. 
For the electrons a combination of triggers is necessary to increase the statistics and to adjust the $p_T$ threshold requirement.

For the trigger efficiencies calculation,  the identification  and isolation criteria on the leptons are applied.
In Fig.~\ref{Fig:trigger} the trigger efficiency for a gluon-gluon fusion signal with mass 300~\GeV is shown for electrons (left) and muons (right).

\section{Study of the Interference effects}
\label{sec:interference}
When a resonance $X$, with a non negligible width is considered, it is important to take into account also the interference effects both with the \WW background , with same initial and final state, and with the Higgs boson off-shell tail. 
In this analysis  the interference effects between the
new signal X produced in gluon-gluon fusion and in vector-boson-fusion is taken into account.
The effect of the various interference terms are shown in ~\ref{fig:X300} and  \ref{fig:Int_VBF_GEN} for the two different production mechanism, gluon-gluon fusion and vector-boson fusion.  The contribution of the interference of high mass resonances $X$ with the \WW background  and with the Higgs boson have opposite sign and partially cancel out. This cancellation effect is different for different resonance masses.
The interference contribution is thus non negligible and is included in the fit, Sec~\ref{StatIn}. \\

\section{Discriminating variable}
This analysis is a shape analysis, meaning that after applying selection cuts, the events are not simply counted, but rather an histogram of a discriminating variable is filled from the data and fitted with the sum of signal and background templates, and finally the signal yield is extracted.
In principle, the variable with the best discriminating power would be the invariant mass of
the four lepton system, however, due to the presence of the neutrinos, it can not be measured.
Usually, in the the Higgs boson to $WW \to 2\ell 2\nu $, the variables used in the analysis are:
\begin{itemize}
\item the transverse mass, $m_T^H$, defined as,  
\begin{equation}
 m_T^H = \sqrt{2p_{\rm T}^{\ell\ell}\MET(1-\mathrm{cos}\Delta\phi(\ell\ell, \ptvecmiss))}
\end{equation}
where $\Delta\phi(\ell\ell, \ptvecmiss)$ is the azimuthal angle between the dilepton momentum and \ptvecmiss;
\item the di-lepton mass, $m_{\ell \ell}$.
\end{itemize}
However, both $m_T^H$ and $m_{\ell \ell}$, are not sensitive to different
signal mass hypothesis. For this reason a new variable, the visible transverse mass,  $m_T^I$, has been used.
This variable, studied for this specific analysis, is defined as the invariant mass of the four momentum resulting from the sum of the
two leptons four-momenta and the missing four-momentum: 
\begin{equation}
 m_T^I = \sqrt{ (p_\mathrm{\ell\ell} + \MET)^2 - (\vec{p}_\mathrm{\ell\ell} + \ptvecmiss)^2 \; .}
\end{equation}
The distribution of all the variables defined above can be compared in 
Fig.~\ref{fig:mt_nocuts}, where it is visible the better power of $m_T^I$ in discriminating different mass hypotheses wth respect to  $m_T^H$ and $m_{\ell \ell}$. The usage of  $m_T^I$ also provides a good discriminating power between signal and background.
