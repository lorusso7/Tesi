\chapter{Semileptonic final state}

\section{General overview}
The $WW \to \ell \nu q \bar{q}$ final state is the dominant decay channel of a SM-like Higgs boson for masses above 200 GeV.
In the mass regime of interest the hadronically decaying boson may be sufficiently boosted that
its decay products are contained in a single merged jet. Jet substructure techniques are used
to identify merged jets with two well defined subjets and to determine the merged jet mass,
helping to discriminate vector boson decays from QCD jets coming from quarks and gluons. If
the hadronic decay products are resolved then the boson decay may be reconstructed as two
quark-jets (a dijet). In this analysis it is first attempted to reconstruct boson candidates using
merged jets, if no boosted candidates are found then dijet reconstruction is attempted.
The leptonically decaying boson is reconstructed as a single isolated lepton and missing transverse energy
orresponding to the neutrino. An estimate of the neutrino longitudinal
momentum is derived by imposing the constraint of the W mass on the invariant mass of the $\ell \nu$ system.
The dominant background processes
are from $W$+jets and top production, with a smaller contribution from diboson, $Z$+Jets and
QCD multijet events. Unlike for the signal the mass distribution of the background events is
not resonant, providing a useful handle to isolate signal events. Data from signal-free control
regions are used to normalize and tune the W+jets and top MC background prediction reducing
the dependence on the simulation.
The kinematic information of the final state particles is fully exploited with the use of a matrix
element based kinematic discriminant to enhance the sensitivity to signal. Identifying addi-
tional jets in the event also leads to increased sensitivity to signal produced through vector-
boson fusion. Effects due to the interference between the signal, the SM Higgs boson and
the WW continuum background are also considered.

\section{Jets for Boosted and Resolved selection}
Hadronic jets are reconstructed with the anti-$k_T$ clustering algorithm  using two different
radius parameters, $R = 0.8$ (AK8) and $R = 0.4$ (AK4). The AK8 algorithm is adopted for
reconstructing the hadronic W decay in a single merged jet when the decay products are highly
collimated, while the AK4 algorithm is used to reconstruct the hadronic W decay when the
decay products are resolved.
Charged Particle Flow
constituents not associated to the primary vertex are not used in the jet clustering procedure.
To avoid double counting of the same object
reconstructed in different collections, jets are required to be separated from the selected isolated
leptons by $\Delta R(lj)> 0.8 $ for AK8 jets by  $\Delta R(lj)> 0.4$ for AK4 jets.
For the selection of $W$ candidates is require two AK4 jets both with $p_T>30$ GeV or an AK8 jet with  $p_T>200$.
The final hadronic $W$ candidate requirements for the merged and resolved analyses
will be discussed in detail in the following.
This analysis also makes use of the n-subjettiness variable~\cite{Thaler:2011gf}  to quantify the compatibility
of AK8 jets with a substructure hypothesis of n-subjets. It is based on the distribution of the
jet constituents with respect to the subjet axes. The ratio of 2-subjettiness and 1-subjettiness,
 $\tau_2 /\tau_1$, allows the dipole structure of hadronic W decays to be distinguished from the monopole
structure of QCD jets.
In order to mitigate the effect of pileup on the jet substructure observables used in this analysis
(softdrop mass and n-subjettiness) the pileup per particle identification (PUPPI)~\cite{Bertolini2014} method is
implemented.

\subsection*{Boosted selection}
For the boosted merged jet analysis an AK8 jet with corrected PUPPI softdrop mass $m_J >$ 40 GeV is required.
To suppress the background from QCD multijet events it is require $MET>40$ GeV.
The $W \to \ell \nu$ and $W \to q \bar{q}$ decay candidates satisfying the boosted analysis requirements are combined into $\ell \nu J$ resonance candidates.
To suppress the dominant $W+$jets background, candidates are selected in the PUPPI softdrop mass region  $65<m_J < 105$, that is the signal region.
For the final selection a cut on the PUPPI n-subjettiness ratio $\tau_2 /\tau_1<0.4$ is used to identify boosted
hadronic boson candidates. The entire selection procedure described above is referred to as the ``boosted selection''.


\subsection*{Resolved selection}
For events which do not pass the boosted jet selection, it is attempted to reconstruct a resolved
hadronic W decay using two AK4 jets.
A kinematic fit is performed to the dijet system using
the $W$ mass constraint, in events with greater than two jets the dijet pair with the smallest $\chi^2$ is
chosen.
To suppress the background from QCD multijet events we require $MET>$30 GeV and
 $W_{m_T} >$ 50 GeV, where $W_{m_T}$ is the transverse mass of the leptonic W candidate. 
The $W \to \ell \nu$ and $W \to q \bar{q}$  decay candidates satisfying these requirements are combined into $\ell \nu jj$ resonance
candidates. To suppress background $\ell \nu jj$ candidates are selected in the dijet mass signal region
65 $< m_{jj} <$ 105 GeV. Sideband and top control regions used for background estimation are
defined as for the boosted selection.
The entire selection procedure described above is referred to as the ``resolved selection''.

\section{Event categorisation}
In this analysis the events are categorised by the flavour of the lepton (electron and muon)
and type of hadronic W candidate (boosted and resolved). To increase the signal sensitivity
further we also divide events into categories based on the tagging of VBF  production and
gluon-gluon fusion for the high mass $X$ production:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf The VBF category}: for the identification of a VBF high mass candidate event, it is required two additional AK4 jets
with $p_T>$ 30 GeV and $\eta <$ 4.7. If there are more then two additional jets then the pair with
the highest invariant mass is chosen. An event enters the VBF category if the dijet pair has a
separation in $\eta$ ,  $\Delta \eta_{jj}$ , greater than 3.5 and an invariant mass, $m_{jj}$ , greater than 500 GeV.
\item {\bf The gluon-gluon fusion category}: those events which are not tagged as VBF selection are considered for the gluon-gluon fusion category. 
The tagging of gluon-gluon fusion  is achieved
using a kinematic discriminant based on the angular distributions of the X candidate decays
products. A kinematic discriminant is constructed as :
\begin{equation}
KD=(1+\frac{c \cdot P_{Bkgr}}{P_{Sig}})^{-1} \: , \end{equation}
where $c$ is a that  may be tuned to adjust the relative normalisations of probabilities. 
$ P_{Bkgr}$ and $P_{Sig}$  are the probability for an event to come from either background or signal respectively calculated using JHUG EN and MCFM.
The discriminant is continuously distributed between 0 and 1, with signal being closer to 1 and background closer to 0. 
In this analysis a cut at 0.5 is used to tag gluon-gluon fusion.
\end{itemize}
Since the decay products of the spin-0 resonance can be fully reconstructed, it is possible to use
the reconstructed resonance mass distribution to discriminate signal events from background
events. The reconstructed mass will peak around the true resonance mass, $m_X$, for the signal,
while for background processes it will have a broader distribution.
