\begin{abstract}


A major breakthrough in modern experimental particle physics came with the discovery of the Higgs boson by the LHC experiments ATLAS and CMS in 2012.
The discovered particle is compatible with the Standard Model (SM) Higgs mechanism predictions: the only unknown parameter, the boson's mass, has been
measured to be  close to 125 GeV. Nevertheless, in order to determine whether the SM Higgs sector is complete, precise measurements of the Higgs boson coupling strengths, $CP$ structure and transverse momentum are required. 
A complementary and important strategy is the search for additional heavy
scalars, that would prove the presence of  beyond-the-SM (BSM) physics in
the form of a non-minimal Higgs sector. The existence of such a sibling Higgs boson,
denoted $X$, is motivated in many BSM scenarios, so the search for additional scalar resonances in the full
mass range accessible at the LHC remains one of the main objectives of the experimental community.\\
The search for a high mass Higgs boson has been performed using Run-I and
early Run-II data in many different decay channels and an upper limit on its
cross section has been determined. With the full 2016 data collected by CMS
experiment at 13 TeV, approximately  36 fb$^{-1}$, it is now possible to set a very tight upper limit on the high mass Higgs boson cross section.
One of the most sensitive decay channels, for Higgs masses above 200 GeV, is the decay to a pair of W bosons. 
The fully leptonic, 2$\ell$2$\nu$,  final state (with $\ell =$ e or $\mu$) is considered in this analysis.\\ 
The fully leptonic channel has a clear signature due to the presence of the two isolated leptons and moderate missing-transverse-energy (MET) that provides indirect evidence of the neutrinos presence.
%This search is similar to the previous analysis \cite{CMS-PAS-HIG-16-023} with several improvements. 
The search is performed in a wide range of masses from 200 GeV up to 3 TeV.
The  events are categories in four differet categories, optimised for the gluon-gluon fusion and for the vector-boson fusion (VBF) production mechanisms.\\
%For the semi-leptonic channel the leptonically decaying boson is reconstructed as a single isolated lepton and MET.
%The hadronically decaying boson may be sufficiently boosted that its decay products are contained in a single merged jet.
%Jet substructure techniques are used to identify merged jets with two well defined subjets and to determine the merged jet mass, helping to discriminate vector bosons from QCD jets originating from quarks and gluons. If the hadronic decay products are resolved then the boson decay products may be reconstructed using two quark-jets (a dijet).\\
%In this channel it is first attempted to reconstruct boson candidates using merged jets, if no boosted candidates are found then dijet reconstruction is attempted.
%Event categories optimised for the ggF and VBF production mechanisms are also included for this channel.
The signal is interpreted in terms of the electroweak (EW) singlet model including a detailed simulation of the on interference between X signal, SM Higgs boson H and WW backgrounds. \\
In addition in the search for new particles, the  Two-Higgs-doublet model (2HDM)  is a well motivated extension of the SM. A final interpretation of the EW singlet model results in term of 2HDM model is also performed.
