\begin{abstract}
This thesis presents a search for a possible heavy Higgs boson, $X$, decaying into a pair of $W$
bosons, in the mass range from 200 GeV to 3 TeV. The analysis is based on proton-proton 
collisions recorded by the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC in 2016, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 
35.9 fb$^{-1}$  at $\sqrt{s}=$13 TeV. The W boson pair decays are reconstructed in the $2\ell 2\nu$  and $\ell\nu q \bar{q}$ final states. 
Both gluon-gluon fusion and electroweak production of the scalar resonance are considered. 
Dedicated event categorizations, based on the kinematic properties of the final states, are employed for an
optimal signal-to-background separation. 
Combined upper limits at the 95\% confidence level on the product of the cross section and branching fraction excludes a heavy Higgs boson  with Standard Model-like couplings and decays in the range of mass investigated.

\chapter{Introduction}
The discovery of the Higgs boson by the LHC experiments ATLAS and CMS in 2012 has been a major breakthrough in modern experimental particle physics.
The discovered particle is compatible with the Standard Model (SM) Higgs mechanism predictions: the only unknown parameter, the boson's mass, has been
measured to be  close to 125 GeV. Nevertheless, in order to determine whether the SM Higgs sector is complete, precise measurements of the Higgs boson coupling strengths, $CP$ structure and transverse momentum are required. 
A complementary and important strategy is the search for additional heavy
scalars, that would prove the presence of  beyond-the-SM (BSM) physics in
the form of a non-minimal Higgs sector. The existence of such a sibling Higgs boson,
denoted $X$, is motivated in many BSM scenarios, so the search for additional scalar resonances in the full
mass range accessible at the LHC remains one of the main objectives of the experimental community.
The search for a high mass Higgs boson has been performed using Run-I and
early Run-II data in many different decay channels and upper limits on its cross section have been determined as a function of the $X$ mass. 
With the full 2016 data collected by CMS experiment at $\sqrt{s}=$13 TeV, approximately  36 fb$^{-1}$, 
it is now possible to set very tight upper limits on the high mass Higgs boson cross section. 
One of the most sensitive decay channels, for masses above 200 GeV, is
the decay to a pair of W bosons. 
The fully leptonic, 2$\ell$2$\nu$,  and the semileptonic, $\ell \nu q \bar{q}$ final state (with $\ell =$ e or $\mu$), are considered in this analysis.
The fully leptonic channel has a clear signature due to the presence of the two isolated leptons and moderate missing-transverse-energy (MET) that provides indirect evidence of the neutrinos presence.
For the semileptonic channel, the leptonically decaying boson is reconstructed as a single isolated lepton and MET.
The hadronically decaying W boson may be reconstructed either as a single jet
(boosted topology) or as two separate jets (resolved topology). 
The search is performed in a wide range of masses from 200 GeV up to 3 TeV.
The  events are classified in  different categories, optimised for the gluon-gluon fusion and for the vector-boson fusion (VBF) production mechanisms.
The signal is interpreted in terms of the electroweak (EW) singlet model, including a detailed simulation of the interference between $X$ signal, SM Higgs boson  and $WW$ backgrounds.
In addition, since  Two-Higgs-doublet models (2HDM)  are a well motivated extension of the SM, a final interpretation of the results in term of 2HDM models is also performed.\\
\newline
The general picture of the SM,  the relative open question and the Higgs boson sector  are described in the first chapter, Chap.~\ref{cap1}. 
The  Electroweak  Singlet model and Two Higgs Doublet Models, used in this analysis, are also introduced in the same chapter. 
%A particular attention is given to the high mass particle, $X$,  in  $WW \to 2\ell 2 \nu$ (fully-leptonic) final state.
In Chap.~\ref{cap2}, the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment at the
CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is described, focusing the attention
on components that allows reconstructing the hunted final state
objects (leptons, jets and MET).
Due to the complexity of  hadron-hadron collision at LHC, Monte Carlo generators are fundamental to simulate the result of such  collisions. 
The various simulations steps and the review of the main Monte Carlo generators are presented in Chap.~\ref{cap3}.
The reconstruction and the identification algorithms providing the
higher level objects used in the analysis, are illustrated in Chap.~\ref{cap4}.
In the Chap.~\ref{cap5}, starting from the reconstructed objects, the analysis strategy for fully leptonic final state  is described, focusing the attention on the signal  modellization and signal identification.
The semileptonic final state analysis is then described in Chap.~\ref{cap6}.
The results for the the fully leptonic and the semileptonic analyses and their final  combination are shown in Chap.~\ref{cap7}.\\

I contributed to each step of this analysis work: starting from data taking, Monte Carlo generation of simulated events, objects identification, event categorization, until the final calculation of upper limits on searched signal, and their interpretation in BSM models. I am the contact person for the fully leptonic analysis. I presented these results in several working meetings and for the internal approval steps. The analysis is under the final review  by the CMS collaboration and it is targeting journal publication in the first months of 2019.\\

\chapter{Boost-invariant variables}
\label{psr}
Since the center-of-mass of the parton-parton scattering is normally boosted in the beam
direction with respect to that of the two incoming hadrons, it is therefore useful to classify
the final state in terms of variables that are invariant under Lorentz transformations in
that direction. For this purpose, the variables rapidity $y$, transverse momentum $p_T$ , and
azimuth angle $\phi$ are introduced. In term of these variables, the four-momentum of a
particle of mass m may be written as,
\begin{equation}
p^{\mu}=(E,p_x,p_y,p_z)
\end{equation}
where where $p_x$ , $p_y$ and $p_z$ are the Cartesian coordinates of the momentum $\vec{p}$. 
The rapidity y is defined by the relation,
\begin{equation}
y=\frac{1}{2} ln (\frac{E+p_z}{E-p_z})
\end{equation}
and is not invariant for relativistic transformations but since it transforms according to
the law $y = y + \beta$, (where $\beta$ is the relative velocity between two frames), the rapidity
differences $\Delta y$ are boost invariant. In the approximation of ultra-relativistic particles rapidity can be approximated by the pseudorapidity $\eta$, defined as:
\begin{equation}
\eta=- ln (tan \frac{\theta}{2}) \sim y
\end{equation}
where $\theta$ is the angle between the particle and the beam direction, and
is therefore directly measurable in the detector.

%\chapter{Parton Distribution Function}
%\label{pdfa}
%In  the hadron colliders, the cross-section of $pp \to F+X $, where $F$ is the final state, is given by,
%\begin{equation}
%d \sigma_{pp \rightarrow F} = \int_0 ^1 dx_1 \int_0 ^1 d x_2 \: f_1(x_1, \mu_F^2) f_2(x_2, \mu_F^2) d \hat{\sigma}_{pp \rightarrow F}(\mu_F ^2)  \mbox{,}\end{equation}
%where  $\hat{\sigma}$ is the partonic cross section, $x_1$ and  $x_2$ are the transverse momentum fraction respect to the incoming parton,  $f_{1,2}(x)$ are the 
%parton distribution function (PDF) giving the probability that a parton has a $x$ momentum fraction of the incoming proton,  $\mu_F$ is the factorization scale.
%The PDF are evaluated via experiments, and their evolution is evaluated with perturbative method, following the Altarelli-Parisi equations (DGLAP)~\cite{Altarelli:1977zs}.
